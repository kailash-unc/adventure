## Introduction

This is a text-based, directional adventure video game that can be played in the console. The player will explore a two-dimensional, gridded map in search of treasures. The player will navigate through the world by entering keyword inputs such as "go north" or "go east" into the console. Each input will return a message based on what the player chose to do and their current surroundings. Some locations in the map will have "chests" containing items; the player can "open" a chest and take the items inside. The goal of the game is to find all the treasure in the map.

Text-based adventure games were first popularized in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Zork, [which you can read about here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) [or play here](https://classicreload.com/zork-i.html), is a classic example of a text-based adventure game like this one.
